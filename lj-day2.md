# Learning Journal - Day 2

Today we learned that the md extention is for the markdown files where # === html files.   We learned the basics of the structure of code and the relationships between JS, CSS, and HTML.

1. This class is structured so that we learn VIEW, or how the viewer sees the information.  
2. *italisized*
3. Packages === preview === and now you should be able to see how markdown works.  Check that out on YOUTUBE
4. Pushing to git === git init --- make sure that you are in the directory/file you want to work in.
5. Working on learning to push things to git right now, and I'm having a little trouble but I think I understand!


# Learning Journal - Day 4

So this day was fun.  I learned a lot from Brandon about the redundancies of many of the things we do.  The point of code is to eliminate useless logic.   

Brandon showed me how we could use an array and call upon these arrays with a for loop function to cut out the unnecessary repeating of the same question structure over and over again.  

I also learned a bit about pseudo code writing to brainstorm ideas on how to get us to the next levels of code!

Paired programing was a blast!
