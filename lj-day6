Day6 Learning Journal Entry _____ Kimmer O'Reilly

Throughout the last couple of days we've been learning about objects.  Fortunately we've been having great people in the class mentor each other.  We've definitely been standing on the shoulders of giants here.  Everyone has been really helpful in making sure that everyone not only keeps on the work load but also understands the material.

Collaboration is so important when it comes to this class and coding in general.

Learning constructor objects and using all of what we have learned before to work with them has been very difficult, and especially using javascript to log all this stuff to DOM after we've completed the work.

Honestly, at this point in the class... I know my grade is good, but I have no idea where I stand lol


Day9 Learning Journal Entry _____ Kimmer O'Reilly

I've learned so much!  I can't believe that how far we've come.

The most intense stuff that we've learned so far is how to create for loops and functions to condense everything in our code.  We've been using these this weeks to create methods for our objects in our object constructors and run through repeat variables to create multiple objects and manipulate these variables in many different ways.

So we've been throwing these objects properties into charts.
