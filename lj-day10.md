Day10  Learning Journal

I love going to the google conference!  I've learned so much from this class, but most importantly, going outside the academics, I've learned about how important everyone in this class is, and diverse their stories.  I have had the pleasure of meeting and talking to almost everyone in class at length and have heard many of their stories.  

I've also learned that connecting with my class mates is a crucial part of the industry.  We will need to eventually connect with future business partners and make connections to get jobs, learn, and provide each other support.  

I want to say thank you to the staff for providing this classroom environment.
