# Learning Journal - Day 4

So this day was fun.  I learned a lot from Brandon about the redundancies of many of the things we do.  The point of code is to eliminate useless logic.

Brandon showed me how we could use an array and call upon these arrays with a for loop function to cut out the unnecessary repeating of the same question structure over and over again.

I also learned a bit about pseudo code writing to brainstorm ideas on how to get us to the next levels of code!

Paired programing was a blast!
