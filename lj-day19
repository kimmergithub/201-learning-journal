Learning Journal day19

We really learned how to use github even though I am still having trouble with things working together inside github.  We haven't had any major merge conflicts or anything so we're all good!  Learning about certain calls where to play them, I really have a better understanding of the code and how to utilize code now!  I know that we must still be newbies, but the reading and coding part of the process (writing) I feel have really come together.
