Day 16 --- Journal

Love the group I'm in, learning a lot.  Everyone is really getting through some tough code and learning a lot.  Our group functions well, and this project is coming out great!
I didn't realize that there were still homework assignments due this week and that's a little off-putting.  Bad assumption, but everything is again is going well.  We problem solve great!
