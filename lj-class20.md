Learning Journal-20

Project Completion!  Congratulations to team RePONG for their final class project completion.  I learned a lot about working with a team on this project.  I rarely work on teams, and know its something that will heavily play a part of a career in coding so I look forward to every opportunity to learn more about how to be an effective team player.
