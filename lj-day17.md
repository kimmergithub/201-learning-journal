Learning Journal Day 17

Halfway through project week, everyone is going strong.  Our group again is on top of their stuff.  We had some major problems with our MainLoop, but we were able to solve those problems late last night :)  Very unique problem with a function that auto refreshed rapidly and we had to move several calls into different js files.  I was a big part in solving the problem and feel really good about my contribution, which is important.  Everyone on the team has contributed in a big way and we're all really proud of what we've done.
