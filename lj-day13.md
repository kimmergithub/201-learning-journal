# Learning Journal - Day 13

The most important lesson I learned today is to never miss a lab!  The labs are so important!  If you miss them then you're going to have  a lot of catching up to do :)

I'm doing my best, I've nearly got caught up on everything.  I just have to get my storage down in the local to track my clicks and then I should have it!
