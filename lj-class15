# Learning Journal - Day 13

The class is coming to a close.  I've learned so much its difficult to quantify here, but I'm very excited about my code fellows journey and the places that it can take me.  I am capable of coding things basic form elements and chart elements with relative comfort.  Working in teams is fun, and people in the groups I've been in are capable and energetic.  Favorite parts of coding so far, have been my understanding of what I can do with code being expanded and realizes all the potential opportunities.
